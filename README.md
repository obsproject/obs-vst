### Info
> In general VST 2.4 is platform independent. There are only three platform
  dependent opcodes :  
  effEditOpen  
  audioMasterGetDirectory  
  audioMasterOpenFileSelector
> 
> Here are the required API changes for 64 bit Mac OS X:
>
> effEditOpen:  
  the [ptr] argument is a WindowRef on 32 bit Mac.  
  On 64 bit this is a NSView pointer. The plug-in needs to add its own NSView as
  subview of it.
>
> audioMasterGetDirectory:  
  the [return value] is a FSSpec on 32 bit Mac.  
  On 64 bit this is a char pointer pointing to an UTF-8 encoded string.
>
> audioMasterOpenFileSelector:  
  the VstFileSelect struct uses FSSpec's on 32 bit Mac.  
  On 64 bit Mac these are char pointers pointing to UTF-8 encoded strings.
